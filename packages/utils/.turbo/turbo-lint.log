(node:22725) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///home/admin/img3/packages/utils/eslint.config.js?mtime=1743516937000 is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /home/admin/img3/packages/utils/package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
